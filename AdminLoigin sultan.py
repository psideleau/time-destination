### Sultan Aljabri


I will handle one of the user story and create a class called :
"ŸêAdminLogin.py"
this class has to contained a default user and password for the admin
to check if it's
the admin in the system or not.
if he in the system he will be able to accese it
or the system will refuse to accept his request.
the other classes(user stories)
that our project provides are are:
1-User class:
    Finding two points
2-Admin class:
    Finding the distance between those two points
3-Traffic class
4-Weather class

Each one of these user story will be in an indivudual calss
and we will use a main class to call them later"""

#the name of the classes will be:

class userLogin:
    # code will be here
