"""Hamdan alshammari
I am going to create a class called :

"userLogin.py"

that will allow users to
login into the system to use the features(user stories)
that our project provides which are:
1-Finding two points
2-Finding the distance between those two points
3-Traffic
4-Weather
5-Speed alert.
Each one of these user story will be in an indivudual calss
and we will use a main class to call them later"""
