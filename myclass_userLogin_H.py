"""Hamdan alshammari

in my task, I am going to create a class called :

"userLogin.py"

this class will test whether the user is registered in the system or not.
if he/she registered will allow them to access to the system. if not they will be asked to creat
a new username and password.
the other classes(user stories)
that our project provides are:
1-User class:
    Finding two points
2-Admin class:
    Finding the distance between those two points
3-Traffic class
4-Weather class
5- SpeedAlert
Each one of these user story will be in an indivudual calss
and we will use a main class to call them later"""
#the name of the classses will be
class userLogin:
    # code here
